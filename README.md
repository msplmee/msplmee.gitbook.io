  This is my blog. It's a collection of notes and knowledge I've gathered from
  exploring the Internet, practicing on my own, and taking courses. It also acts
  as a simple portfolio for me.

## HTB writeups

I've written about the machines I've done on HTB. HTB is a place to get better at cybersecurity. I'll share what I've learned from there. My writeups might be long, but I want to make them detailed. It feels really good when I figure out challenges by myself 😤

## CVE & Bug bounty

I'll create detailed writeups about my CVEs and bug bounty experiences, as long as I'm permitted to share this information publicly.

## Disclaimer

I'm not claiming to be the best or really good at security. I'm just a girl who loves security and wants to learn a lot.

If I wrote something wrong, please tell me :love\_letter:
